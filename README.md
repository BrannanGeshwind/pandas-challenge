# pandas-challenge
Repo for challenge using pandas

Finished project (7/13) - pushing to repository
- Requested assistance from TA regarding:
    school_spending_df['Per Student Budget'] = school_spending_df['Per Student Budget'].str.replace("$","").astype(float)
Code was worked on together as there was an error I couldn't figure out with converting information in the school_spending dataframe from a string to a float.

For the analysis, in the Jupyter Labs notebook, there was a section for the analysis of the information. I've included my analysis there, however, if need be I can submit as an additional .txt file.
